I believe any organization, whatever the size or purpose, can take advantage of scientific theory and methods for achieving its goal. Benefits from using available knowledge are great for individual wealth and **social welfare**. As my academic background is between Economics (Micro) & Statistics, the topics are mostly limited to those disciplines. So the blog aims primarily at showing the good use of statistical methods on economic issues. The second goal is just for pedagogical reasons as I learn better by building example cases.
